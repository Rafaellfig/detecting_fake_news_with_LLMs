Activists said regime forces bombed the town of Saraqib in rural Idlib with chlorine-filled barrel bombs on Monday causing over 30 cases of asphyxiation among civilians. The attacks were carried out in a blatant violation of UN Security Council resolutions 2118 and 2235 banning the use of chemical weapons and toxic substances. In a press release issued earlier on Tuesday the Syrian Coalition called upon the UN Security Council to shoulder its responsibilities towards stopping such attacks. It stressed that urgent measures must be taken under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations to protect the Syrian people. Any further delay in taking firm stance towards such attacks will open the door to more crimes and violations by the Assad regime the Coalition said. Separately over 12 civilians were killed and dozens injured including women and children when Russian jets raided the village of Abu Alduhour in rural Idlib on Monday. Five civilians were also killed in similar attacks on the village of Tal Toughan in rural Idlib. Activists said that the bombings were carried out by Russian forces in revenge for the death of five crewmen killed when their helicopter crashed near the town of Saraqib on Monday. The Syrian Coalition emphasized the need for the international community to assume its responsibilities regarding the protection of civilians in accordance with International Law (IL) and International Humanitarian Law (IHL) to stop war crimes and eliminate the constant threat of the use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime.

The bombing also destroyed civilian property and wounded several people some of them critically the Britain-based Observatory added. President Bashar al-Assads air force has carried out near-daily strikes against areas under rebel control in the northern province since last December killing several hundred people mostly civilians. Rights groups have repeatedly criticised the use of barrel bombs which they say fail to discriminate between civilian and military targets. In July Human Rights Watch accused the regime of defying a UN Security Council resolution ordering all sides in Syrias war to stop indiscriminate attacks. Syrias multi-front war began as a peaceful movement demanding democratic change but morphed into an all-out civil war after Assads regime unleashed a brutal crackdown against dissent.

1923848279,Dozens of civilians dead in rebel assault on Aleppo,"Dozens of civilians dead in rebel assault on Aleppo AFP Sunday 30 Oct 2016 Syrias regime and rebels were locked in fierce fighting Sunday on Aleppos western edges where 38 civilians have been killed in a two-day opposition offensive to break the government siege. Rebels and allied militants launched a major offensive on Friday to break through government lines and reach the 250000 people living in the citys east. Since then they have unleashed a salvo of rockets artillery shells and car bombs around the western government-controlled districts. Syrias second city Aleppo has been devastated by some of the heaviest fighting of the countrys five-year civil war which has killed more than 300000 people. Much of the once-bustling economic hub has been reduced to rubble by air and artillery bombardment including barrel bombs - crude unguided explosive devices that cause indiscriminate damage. ""Rebel fighters have launched hundreds of rockets and shells onto the western districts from positions inside the city and on its western edges"" said Rami Abdel Rahman head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Two days of such heavy rebel bombardment have killed 38 civilians including 14 children and wounded another 250. Fighting has also killed 30 regime and allied fighters as well as 50 Syrian rebels according to the Observatory. The monitor did not have an immediate death toll for foreign anti-regime fighters many of whom have joined the militants factions. About 1500 rebels have massed on a 15-kilometre front along the western edges of Aleppo since Friday scoring quick gains in the Dahiyet al-Assad district but struggling to push east since then. ""The advance will be from Dahiyet al-Assad towards Hamdaniyeh"" said Yasser al-Youssef of the Noureddin al-Zinki rebel faction. Hamdaniyeh is a regime-held district directly adjacent to opposition-controlled eastern neighbourhoods. Fighting lasted all night and into Sunday with air strikes and artillery fire along the western battlefronts heard even in the eastern districts an AFP correspondent there said. Plumes of smoke could be seen snaking up from the citys skyline. A pro-regime military source told AFP that the rebel assault was ""massive and coordinated"" but insisted it was unable to break into any neighbourhoods besides Dahiyet al-Assad. ""Theyre using Grad missiles and car bombs and are supported by foreign fighters in their ranks"" he said. Those waging the assault include Aleppo rebels and reinforcements from Idlib province to the west among them the militant Fateh al-Sham Front which changed its name from Al-Nusra Front after breaking ties with Al-Qaeda. Aleppos front line runs through the heart of the city dividing rebels in the east from government troops in the west. In late September government troops launched their own assault to recapture all of the eastern rebel-controlled territory. It was backed by fierce air strikes from Russia which launched its own air war in 2015 to back President Bashar al-Assads forces. That onslaught spurred massive international criticism of both Moscow and Damascus. Last week Russia implemented a three-day ""humanitarian pause"" intended to allow civilians and surrendering rebels to leave Aleppos east but few did so. Moscow says it will continue a halt on air strikes over Aleppo in place since October 18. The Russian military said Friday it had asked President Vladimir Putin for authorization to resume the raids. But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Putin ""considers it inappropriate at the current moment"" adding that the president thought it necessary to ""continue the humanitarian pause"" in Aleppo.",ahram,10/30/16

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights based in Britain said nine children were among those killed as they tried to cross the river aboard rafts escaping from areas where Russian-backed regime forces are battling the Daesh terror group. The monitor which earlier gave a toll of 20 in the strikes said the dead included an Iraqi family. Deir Ezzor borders Iraq and civilians have fled into the province to escape the battles against Daesh in their own country. Two campaigns are being fought against Daesh in east Deir Ezzor with one on the western side of the Euphrates river that slices diagonally across the province led by Syrian troops and backed by ally Russia. The second is being fought by the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces an alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters on the eastern bank of the river. The observatory relies on a network of sources inside Syria and says it determines whose planes carry out raids according to type location flight patterns and munitions used. The group has reported hundreds of civilians killed in operations against Daesh in Deir Ezzor and neighbouring Raqqa province where the SDF is fighting with US support to capture the former extremist bastion Raqqa city. On Tuesday the observatory said a US-led coalition strike in Raqqa killed at least 18 civilians. The coalition says it takes all measures possible to avoid civilian casualties and that it investigates each credible allegation. Last month it acknowledged the deaths of over 700 civilians in its strikes in Syria and Iraq since 2014. Russia has not acknowledged any civilian deaths from its strikes since its intervened in Syrias war in 2015 and dismisses the observatorys reporting as biased. The deaths in Deir Ezzor on Wednesday prompted outrage from the opposition Syrian National Coalition which described the incident as a heinous crime. More than 330000 people have been killed in Syria since the conflict began in March 2011 with anti-government protests.,jordantimes,10/22/17

World leaders have responded to the claim by activists in the Syrian Revolution General Commission that at least 640 people were killed in a nerve gas attack on Syrias Ghouta region. The Arab League called Wednesday on U.N. chemical weapons inspectors now inside Syria to immediately visit the site of the incident. Arab League chief Nabil al-Arabi urged the inspectors in a statement to go immediately to Eastern Ghouta to see the reality of the situation and investigate the circumstances of this crime. Britain said on Wednesday it would raise a reported chemical weapons attack by forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad at the United Nations Security Council and called on Damascus to give U.N. inspectors access to the site Reuters reported. I am deeply concerned by reports that hundreds of people including children have been killed in airstrikes and a chemical weapons attack on rebel-held areas near Damascus British Foreign Secretary William Hague said in a statement. France also called for action by the U.N. during a cabinet session Hollande announced his intention to ask the U.N. to visit the site of the attack government spokeswoman Najat Vallaud-Belkacem told reporters on Wednesday. This information obviously requires verification and confirmation she added. The chief of a U.N. inspectors team visiting Syria says he wants to look into the claims. Swedish chemical weapons expert Ake Sellstrom says the high numbers of killed and wounded being reported sound suspicious. He told Swedish broadcaster SVT that this sounds like something we need to look into. Turkey also called on U.N. inspectors to look into Syrian rebel reports and said it was monitoring the situation with great concern. Light must immediately be shed on these claims and the United Nations mission that was formed to investigate chemical weapons claims in Syria should look into these claims and reveal its findings the Foreign Ministry said in a statement. If these allegations are found to be true it will be inevitable for the international community to take the necessary stance and give the necessary response to this savagery and crime against humanity it said. The opposition Syrian National Coalition called for an urgent U.N. Security Council meeting on the subject. I call on the Security Council to convene urgently National Coalition leader Ahmed al-Jarba told Al-Arabiya news channel condemning the Syrian armys bombardment of the Ghouta suburbs of Damascus as a massacre.

1924058031,Israeli attack on Syria military camp kills three | Jordan Times,"Last updated at Apr 232017 An Israeli attack on a Syrian training camp near the Golan Heights killed three members of a pro-government militia on Sunday an official from the forces said. The Al Fawwar camp in Syrias southwestern Quneitra province is used by the National Defence Forces (NDF) which command some 90000 fighters across Syria. The NDF official told AFP that two fighters were also wounded in the Israeli attack but said it was unclear whether the damage was inflicted by an air strike or shelling. Another Syrian source inside the training camp told AFP that around 600am local time (0300 GMT) ""security guards at the camp saw what looked like three fireballs coming towards the camp"". ""Then there were several consecutive blasts because of the explosion of ammunition warehouses"" that firefighters worked hard to extinguish the source said. The source also said that they were ""Israeli rockets"" but could not specify what kind of missiles may have been used. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said the attack had targeted a ""weapons warehouse"" in the camp. Israels army declined to comment Sunday on the attack. On Friday the Israeli army said it targeted positions inside Syria in retaliation for mortar fire that hit the northern part of the Golan Heights. At the time Syrias official news agency SANA said Israel had struck a Syrian army position in the province of Quneitra on the Golan plateau ""causing damage"". The Syrian government labels rebel groups and militants fighting the regime as ""terrorists"" and accuses Israel of backing them. Israel seized 1200 square kilometres of the Golan from Syria in the Six-Day War of 1967 and later annexed it in a move never recognised by the international community. Around 510 square kilometres of the Golan are under Syrian control. The two countries are still technically at war although the border remained largely quiet for decades until 2011 when the Syrian conflict broke out. The Israeli side is hit sporadically by what are usually deemed to be stray rounds and Israel has recently taken to opening fire in retaliation.",jordantimes,4/13/17

Residents spent the night huddled together in their apartments sharing news about the collapsing truce by messenger. Aleppo like other major front lines in Syria had been relatively calm for the first few days after the truce brokered by Moscow and Washington came into effect on September 12. Violence slowly escalated late last week culminating at the weekend in deadly airstrikes on Aleppo and a US-led raid that killed scores of Syrian soldiers fighting the Islamic State group in the east. Fighting also intensified in the rebel-held eastern suburbs of Damascus where the army announced a major military operation on Monday just hours before declaring the ceasefire over.

The Syrian Coalition condemns the brutal massacre committed by Assads air force in Raqqa today where 65 civilians were killed and dozens wounded in multiple air raids that targeted civilian neighborhoods in the city. Hadi al-Bahra president of the Syrian Coalition warns that the Assad regime will repeat such brutal aerial shelling; pointing out that many seem now convinced that Assad is the major beneficiary of the US-led coalition strikes against ISIS. He calls for the US-led coalition to rethink its strategy in Syria. Activists said that Assads warplanes conducted nine air raids on the city of Al Raqqa killing dozens of civilians and causing massive material damage to the residential areas pointing out none of ISIS positions were targeted in the attacks. Bahra calls on civil and human rights organizations and activists around the world to take action to support the Syrian peoples demands for freedom democracy by all means. it is disappointing how there are dozens of sides that support extremist organizations with money and men and how there are several international sides that support Assad with militiamen weapons money and diplomatic backing while the international community has so far failed to support the Syrian peoples demands for freedom and democracy.

In Jassem in the southern province of Daraa 15 civilians were killed in four air strikes while 25 others were wounded said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The strikes in response to a major rebel offensive that has been underway in southern Syria for months. ""As usual the regime is striking populated areas in order to make civilian supporters of opposition fighters turn against them"" Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman said. Rebels fighting to oust President Bashar al-Assad have suffered a spate of defeats at the hands of his forces but they still have the upper hand in Daraa. ""Opposition fighters are making steady progress in Daraa province. The vast majority of the west of the province has completely fallen out of government control and that is where Jassem is located"" Abdel Rahman said. Rebel fighters in the area benefit from ""the fact that supply lines from Jordan are still open"" he added. The involvement of experienced fighters of Syrias Al-Qaeda affiliate the Al-Nusra Front has also helped the rebels to gain territory in Daraa. Elsewhere air strikes on Douma the besieged rebel-held town east of Damascus killed at least six civilians and wounded dozens more the Observatory said. An AFP photographer in Douma said the strikes hit residential areas and that most of the wounded were children. At Khan Sheikhun in the northwestern province of Idlib 11 people were killed including a former army officer who had defected from the loyalist army to join opposition forces said the Observatory. The regime first deployed warplanes in the Syrian war in July 2012. Now nearly four years into the conflict there are air strikes every day despite repeated warnings from the international community that such tactics fail to discriminate between civilian and military targets.

1923102941,Deadly Aleppo convoy attack threatens aid distribution in Syria,"Date of publication 21 September 2016 The United Nations has suspended aid distribution in Syria after an attack on an aid convoy in Urum al-Kubra but has vowed to continue working in the war-torn country. The targeting of an aid convoy in Aleppo early this week has resulted in international condemnation forced the United Nations to suspend their aid operations inside Syria and threatened aid distribution within the war-torn country. On Monday evening a convoy of 31 lorries carrying supplies for 78000 people including vitamins and blankets books and pencils for children and medicine to treat burns and diabetes was targeted by purported airstrikes in the town of Urum al-Kubra a town in the western Aleppo Governorate northwestern Syria. 	 	 In the attack 18 of the 31 lorries were destroyed and 20 civilians were killed. The dead included Omar Barakat head of the local branch of the Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC). Barakat is said to have died of his wounds as emergency services tried desperately to reach the area. On Tuesday SARC the International Committee of the Red Cross and the International Federation of Red Crescent Societies released a joint statement expressing ""outrage"" at the ""horrific attack"". ""Were devastated by the deaths of so many people including one of our colleagues. He was a committed and brave member of our family of committed staff and volunteers working relentlessly to alleviate the suffering of the Syrian people"" said SARC President Dr Abdulrahman Attar. Speaking to The New Arab Mona Kurdi a spokesperson for SARC noted that the attack on the convoy occurred in the vicinity of a SARC distribution centre. ""It was just a warehouse everyone knew this"" said Kurdi. Laila Kiki a media spokesperson for The Syria Campaign which networks with aid groups inside Syria including Syrian Civil Defence or ""White Helmets"" units expressed similar dismay.

A convoy of 31 lorries carrying supplies for 78000 people including vitamins and blankets books and pencils for children and medicine to treat burns and diabetes was targeted by purported airstrikes	 	 End to US-Russian brokered ceasefire? Humanitarian groups including Human Rights Watch have since called for investigations into the attack. The attack appeared to signal the end of a Russian-US brokered ceasefire that came into force in Syria on the evening of September 12. But on Tuesday morning US Secretary of State John Kerry speaking alongside his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov during an interval from a bleak meeting of the International Syria Support Group (ISSG) ministers in New York insisted the ceasefire was ""not dead."" Later in the day Reuters reported that preliminary conclusions reached by US officials based on their intelligence pointed to Russian responsibility. Videos recorded on the ground at the time show a dark still night sky interrupted by bright red-orange bursts of flame accompanied by loud reverberating bangs with panic stricken voices relaying that aid cars have been hit. One media activist who spoke to BBC Arabic and witnessed the attack said that the first strike against the convoy occurred at around 7 pm local time on Monday evening when a helicopter dropped a number of barrel bombs. Later attacks the media activist said saw rocket and machine gun fire from aircraft. 	 	Videos recorded on the ground at the time show a dark still night sky interrupted by bright red-orange bursts of flame accompanied by loud reverberating bangs with panic stricken voices relaying that aid cars have been hit	 	 Russia deny responsibility However Russia has denied any responsibility. On Tuesday Russian defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said that videos recorded at the scene showed no evidence of ""munitions hitting the convoy"" and instead attributed the destruction to ""a fire"". UN officials say that the convoy travelling to Urum al-Kubra had received necessary clearances and all parties had been notified of its journey and agenda. The organisations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) revealed in a statement on Tuesday that it first became aware the aid convoy had come under attack at 8.15 pm local time. A matter of hours earlier Syrian state media published an article stating that the Syrian Army had declared the ceasefire over citing 300 violations committed by rebel groups who had used the agreement a pretext to ""mobilise and re-assemble."" In the immediate aftermath of the attack confusion spread over whether the aid convoy hit in Urum al-Kubra had travelled to Aleppo from the Turkish border. Last week a convoy of 20 aid trucks carrying enough supplies to feed 185000 people in rebel-held east Aleppo for a month remained stuck awaiting necessary clearances. However an informed source within the UN told The New Arab that the targeted convoy had travelled to Urum al-Kubra from a UN hub in government-controlled west Aleppo. ""The convoy waiting at Bab al-Hawa never left"" said the UN source. 	 	 Warplanes return to Aleppo skies On Tuesday in the aftermath of the attack the familiar yet deadly sight of government helicopters and warplanes patrolling the skies after a week of relative calm returned to rebel-held east Aleppo. Civilian casualties from government bombardment were reported by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights in areas including the al-Sekkari and al-Merja neighbourhoods and Janah al-Salama in the countryside east of Aleppo. ""It was calmer last week but today there was shelling at seven in the morning and it continued during the day"" said Mohamad Abu Rajab a nurse based in a hospital in eastern Aleppo supported by the Syrian American Medical Association. ""We lack equipment like CT scans and other things to treat the injured and there is nowhere for people here to go. ""There is no way out"" continued Abu Rajab explaining that he often worked 20 hour shifts rarely left the hospital and was forced to work in a basement to avoid the devastating effects of aerial munitions routinely dropped on the city. ""The people civilians they want to live in peace"" said Abu Rajab noting that supplies of fuel for stoves and basic food were running low in the city leading prices to skyrocket. 	 	We lack equipment like CT scans and other things to treat the injured and there is nowhere for people here to go - Mohamad Abu Rajab medic in opposition-held east Aleppo	 	 Aid distribution threatened On Tuesday Kevin Kennedy OCHAs regional humanitarian coordinator for Syria said that the attacks in Urum al-Kubra were inexcusable showed a ""blatant disregard for the lives of humanitarian workers"" and constituted a violation of ""all basic principles of law and humanity."" The attacks have cast serious questions about how vital aid will be distributed to communities within Syria such as the estimated 300000 strong community of rebel-held east Aleppo. Despite temporarily suspending operations in Syria OCHA has reaffirmed its commitment to aid distribution within Syria stating ""United Nations humanitarian agencies are needed now more than ever and will stay and deliver for the people of Syria regardless of where they are in the country."" Laila Kiki of The Syria Campaign noted with concern that that the humanitarian situation in rebel-held east Aleppo would only worsen if aid went undelivered. ""This attack seems like a new low.

1923848146,Suspected gas attack on Syrias rebel-held Idlib kills at least 58 Observatory,"Tuesday 4 Apr 2017 Suspected gas attack on Syrias rebel-held Idlib kills at least 58 Observatory Reuters A suspected gas attack believed to be by Syrian government jets killed at least 58 people including 11 children under the age of eight in the northwestern province of Idlib on Tuesday a war monitor and medical workers in the rebel-held area said. A Syrian military source strongly denied the army had used any such weapons. The attack caused many people to choke or faint and some had foam coming out of their mouths the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said citing medical sources who described it as a sign of a gas attack. The air strikes on the town of Khan Sheikhoun in the south of rebel-held Idlib also wounded more than 60 people said the Observatory a British-based war monitoring group. ""This morning at 630 a.m. warplanes targeted Khan Sheikhoun with gases believed to be sarin and chlorine"" said Mounzer Khalil head of Idlibs health authority adding that the attack had killed more than 50 people and wounded 300. ""Most of the hospitals in Idlib province are now overflowing with wounded people"" he told a news conference in Idlib. Warplanes later struck near a medical point where victims of the attack were being treated the Observatory said and civil defence workers said. The civil defence also known as the White Helmets - a rescue service that operates in opposition areas of Syria - said jets struck one of its centres in the area and the nearby medical point. It would mark the deadliest chemical attack in Syria since sarin gas killed hundreds of civilians in Ghouta near Damascus in August 2013. Western states said the Syrian government was responsible for that attack. Damascus blamed it on rebels. Military Denies The Syrian military source on Tuesday denied allegations that government forces had used chemical weapons dismissing the accounts as rebel propaganda. The army ""has not and does not use them not in the past and not in the future because it does not have them in the first place"" the source said. A joint inquiry for the United Nations and the global chemical weapons watchdog has previously accused government forces of toxic gas attacks. France called for an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting about Tuesdays suspected attack. Reuters photographs showed people breathing through oxygen masks and wearing protection suits while others carried the bodies of dead children and corpses wrapped in blankets were lined up on the ground. Activists in northern Syria circulated pictures on social media showing a purported victim with foam around his mouth and rescue workers hosing down almost naked children squirming on the floor. Most of the towns streets had become empty a witness said. The conflict pits President Bashar al-Assads government helped by Russia and Iranian-backed militias against a wide array of rebel groups including some that have been supported by Turkey the United States and Gulf monarchies. The Russian Defence Ministry said on Tuesday that Russian planes had not carried out air strikes on Idlib. Syrian and Russian air strikes have battered parts of Idlib despite a ceasefire that Turkey and Russia brokered in December according to the Observatory. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed the suspected attack Turkish presidential sources said. They said the two leaders had also emphasised the importance of maintaining the ceasefire. Population Ballooned Idlib province contains the largest populated area controlled by the anti-Assad rebels - both nationalist Free Syrian Army groups and Islamist factions including the former al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front. Idlibs population has ballooned with thousands of fighters and civilians shuttled out of Aleppo city and areas around Damascus that the government has retaken in recent months. U.S. air strikes since January have also hit several areas in the rural province where jihadists have a powerful presence. The United Nations and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons have been investigating whether Damascus is adhering to its commitments under the 2013 agreement which averted the threat of U.S.-led military intervention. In a report in October last year the inquiry said that government forces used chemical weapons at least three times in 2014-2015 and that Islamic State used mustard gas in 2015. Following the 2013 Ghouta attack the Syrian government joined the international Chemical Weapons Convention under a U.S.-Russian deal. The government which denied its forces were behind the Ghouta attack also agreed to hand over its declared stockpile of 1300 tonnes of toxic weaponry and dismantle its chemical weapons program under international supervision. Damascus has repeatedly denied using such weapons during the six-year war which has killed hundreds of thousands and created the worlds worst refugee crisis.",ahram,4/4/17

1924058070,Russia says it kills 180 extremists mercenaries in Syria claims Shishani_s death | Jordan Times,Last updated at Oct 082017 MOSCOW Some 120 Daesh terror group extremists and 60 foreign mercenaries were killed in a series of Russian air strikes in Syria over the past 24 hours the defence ministry in Moscow said on Saturday. Puzzlingly the ministry also said three senior Daesh commanders including Omar Al Shishani had been confirmed dead as a result of an earlier Russian strike. Moscow reported Shishanis death despite the fact that the Pentagon said in 2016 the notorious fighter had been killed by American troops in Iraq. A command post of the terrorists and up to 80 [Daesh] fighters including nine natives of the Northern Caucasus were destroyed in the area of Mayadeen the ministry said adding that another 40 Daesh fighters were killed around the town of Albu Kamal. Mayadeen is one of Daeshs last bastions in Syria. In another air strike more than 60 foreign mercenaries from the former Soviet Union Tunisia and Egypt were killed in the Euphrates Valley south of Deir Ezzor. The ministry said large numbers of foreign mercenaries were coming into the Syrian border town of Albu Kamal from Iraq. It also said Russian forces had killed senior Daesh commanders Omar Al Shishani Alaa Al Din Al Shishani and Salah Al Din Al Shishani all natives of the Northern Caucasus. Moscow reported their deaths after taking several days to confirm the results of an earlier strike on the northern outskirts of Albu Kamal which destroyed a Daesh command post with more than 30 fighters including the natives of the Northern Caucasus. Omar the Chechen The Pentagon announced in March 2016 that American forces had killed Shishani one of the most notorious faces of Daesh known for his thick red beard. Shishani whose nom de guerre means Omar the Chechen came from the former Soviet state of Georgias Pankisi Gorge region which is populated mainly by ethnic Chechens. He fought as a Chechen rebel against Russian forces before joining the Georgian military in 2006 and fought Russian forces again in Georgia in 2008. He later resurfaced in northern Syria as the commander of a group of foreign fighters and became a senior leader within Daesh. The Russian defence ministry was not immediately available for further comment. Rami Abdel Rahman head of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights disagreed with Moscows report. Salah Al Din Al Shishani is still alive and is somewhere in the regions controlled by extremist groups in the west of Aleppo province. He is a famous commander and his extremist group is allied with the extremists of Al Nusra Front but only in their fight against the regime he said. He has no links with Daesh The advances against Daesh in Deir Ezzor have resulted in a heavy civilian death toll through Russian and coalition air raids. The observatory said Russian air strikes on Thursday night killed 14 people including three children fleeing across the Euphrates on rafts near Mayadeen. Since it intervened in Syria in 2015 Russia has not acknowledged any civilian deaths from its strikes and it dismisses the observatorys reporting as biased. Moscow has been staging air strikes in support of its ally Damascus targeting both Daesh in Deir Ezzor province and rival extremists led by Al Qaedas former Syria affiliate in Idlib province in the northwest.,jordantimes,10/8/17

A mosque was also destroyed by regime airstrikes north of Hama in the west-central region of the country local civil defense sources said Friday. A civil defense official in Idlib Leys el-Faris told Anadolu Agency four civilians were killed and seven others injured in an airstrike which hit the Sermin district. According to Faris a number of residential areas were destroyed in the attack. The Abu Ubaidah Ibn al-Jarrah mosque north of Hama city in Kafr Zeita was also destroyed by Russian airstrikes. ""The regime is intensively attacking rural areas in Idlib and Hama with its allies"" Faris said. Videos and images of the destroyed mosque have been circulating online. Speaking to Anadolu Agency Yusuf el-Bustani a local activist said regime forces were attacking the opposition-controlled Qaboun neighborhood of the capital Damascus. Bustani said four civilians had been injured in the attack. He added local people had difficulties in meeting basic needs due to regime forces attack in East Ghouta. Syria has been locked in a vicious civil war since early 2011 when the Assad regime cracked down on pro-democracy protests with unexpected ferocity. Several rounds of peace talks - in Geneva and the Kazakh capital Astana - have so far failed to end the conflict in which hundreds of thousands of Syrian civilians are believed to have been killed to date. The namesake of the destroyed mosque Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah was one of the companions of the prophet Muhammad and converted to Islam in 611. Like many of the early Muslims of Mecca Abu Ubaidah experienced hardships because of his faith and migrated to Abyssinia (Ethiopia) with a delegation at Muhammads suggestion. Abu Ubaidah joined Muhammad when the prophet migrated from Mecca to Medina in 622.

1926479371,Rebel-held zone of Syrias Aleppo braces for renewed bombardment,November 4 2016 Rebel-held zone of Syrias Aleppo braces for renewed bombardment. Ellen Francis Angus McDowall. Syrian rebels and civilians showed no sign of leaving the besieged opposition-held sector of Aleppo on Friday despite a Russian deadline to resume bombing Syrias largest city at nightfall after a 17-day pause. The rebels own shelling of residential parts of government-held western Aleppo has meanwhile killed dozens in the past week as insurgent groups staged a counter-attack from outside the city aimed at breaking the siege on areas they control. The government sent ambulances and buses to bring people out of the besieged zone as it has done at other times during the pause but there was still no sign that anybody would leave. Residents contacted by Reuters seemed resigned to the resumption in bombing which killed hundreds of people in late September and early October as the government and its Russian allies abandoned a ceasefire to launch their assault on the biggest urban area in opposition hands. Nothing can be done. Nobody can stop the planes said Bebars Mishal an official with the white helmets civil defense volunteer group in eastern Aleppo which digs victims out of the rubble and runs an ambulance service. He said there was no way for rescue workers or medical staff to prepare in advance of the expected resumption of attacks: All we can do is take precautions and be ready 24 hours a day. Moscow and Damascus say their pause in bombing the city will end at 7 pm (1700 GMT) accusing rebels of having used the pause to reinforce and launch attacks on government-held areas. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said that by around 8:30 pm local time there was no sign yet of resumed aerial bombardment of central parts of the city. The government and its Russian allies say they target only militants and that fighters are to blame for civilian casualties by operating in civilian areas. Western countries say the bombing has deliberately targeted hospitals aid workers and bakeries and Washington has accused Moscow of war crimes. Rebels say the aim is to drive out civilians some 275000 of whom remain in the besieged zone. They call it a ceasefire. The regime hasnt let us hear the end of it said Modar Shekho a nurse in rebel-held eastern Aleppo. As usual when it ends they will let the bombardment loose. Weve gotten used to this. Syrias army backed by Lebanese Iranian and Iraqi Shiite militias and Russias air force launched a major offensive to retake eastern Aleppo from rebel groups on Sept. 22 after a series of advances allowed them to besiege it this summer. Aleppo has become the focal point of fighting in Syrias war now in its sixth year pitting President Bashar al-Assad and his allies against Sunni rebel groups including some supported by Turkey Gulf Arab monarchies and the United States. The city has been divided between the government-held western sector and rebel-held east for years. Winning full control of it would be the biggest victory so far for Assads government in a war that has killed many hundreds of thousands of people and driven more than half of Syrians from their homes. NOBODY WILL LEAVE Damascus and Moscow declared a unilateral four-day pause in strikes on Oct. 18 promising rebels and residents safe passage to leave the city and have extended it for most days since although some attacks have continued. Russia which has brought an additional aircraft carrier to Syrias coast said on Wednesday that all rebels must leave Aleppo by Friday evening adding its moratorium on air strikes could not be extended because of rebel shelling. A witness in western Aleppo at Bustan al-Qasr near a crossing point set up by the government to allow civilians to flee the rebel area told Reuters on Friday he could see people waiting for relatives to come from the east. Buses and ambulances were waiting for them but so far there was no sign of an exodus. A woman at Bustan al-Qasr who was covering her face said she hoped the people in eastern Aleppo would be able to leave safely and peacefully. Rebels have rejected the demand they withdraw. Nobody will leave and the Russians will escalate. The Russians declared this said Zakaria Malahifji a Turkey-based official from the politburo of the Fastaqim group which is present in Aleppo. The opposition says Damascus and its Russian and Iranian allies aim to win the war by depopulating rebel-held areas starving the population out or bombing them into flight. The Russians are adopting a policy of demographic change with the regime and Iran and their intentions are no longer hidden an official from the Nour al-Din al-Zinki rebel group said. In recent months other opposition-held areas have surrendered after long army sieges. The government calls the process reconciliation offering safe passage out for rebel fighters who abandon territory and lay down their arms. It has proposed a similar program to end the siege of eastern Aleppo opening what the army calls safe corridors and sending ambulances for injured civilians and green city buses to transport fighters to Idlib a rebel-held area. But so far only a very small number of people have left the rebel-held zone since late October. Damascus has accused rebels of stopping people from leaving including by shelling the safe corridors which rebels have denied. I wish civilians would exit ... but I expect that wont happen not under these circumstances Fadi Ismail an official based in Aleppo in Syrias reconciliation ministry told Reuters via telephone. Ismail said prospects for a deal with rebels looked bleak. There must be military action of course he said if no one evacuated. The United Nations has said it does not have security guarantees needed to deliver aid into eastern Aleppo. It opposes evacuations of civilians from besieged areas unless they are voluntary. After their offensive began in late September pro-government forces managed to take ground in northern Aleppo including a camp for Palestinian refugees and smaller areas in the south but made fewer advances into densely populated areas. Rebels launched a counter-attack a week ago against the western edge of government-held areas from the surrounding countryside. They have made progress in the Dahiyet al-Assad suburb and the 1070 apartment blocks district using 15 suicide car bomb attacks during the week a war monitor said. The Observatory said the rebels had killed 69 civilians including 25 children in shelling during their counter-attack.

1924058065,Syrian government push for Damascus rebel enclave kills at least 23 | Jordan Times,"Last updated at Nov 272017 BEIRUT An intensifying push by the Syrian government and allied forces to take the last major rebel stronghold near the capital Damascus killed at least 23 people on Sunday and injured many the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The group said at least 127 people including 30 children have been killed by air strikes and shelling since the Syrian army backed by Russian jets began an offensive nearly two weeks ago to take the besieged rebel-held Eastern Ghouta area. Eastern Ghouta is one of several ""de-escalation"" zones across western Syria where Russia has brokered deals to ease the fighting between rebels and President Bashar Assads government. A Reuters witness said there had been drones in the sky since Sunday morning and warplanes had heavily bombarded the towns of Mesraba and Harasta. Heavy shelling also hit Eastern Ghouta and dozens had been injured. Assads forces have besieged Eastern Ghouta since 2012 and the area is suffering a humanitarian crisis. Ghouta residents are so short of food that they are eating trash fainting from hunger and forcing their children to eat on alternate days the UN World Food Programme said in a report this week. The opposition Eastern Ghouta Damascus Countryside local council said this week the escalating bombardment was forcing people to seek shelter in unsuitable and unsanitary places which it feared could lead to disease outbreaks. A number of shells from the rebel enclave have hit government-held Damascus in the past two weeks. Syrias six-year-old civil war has killed hundreds of thousands of people and forced millions to flee in the worst refugee crisis since World War II. UN-backed peace negotiations are due to begin in Geneva on November 28. Several previous rounds of Geneva talks have failed to agree a political transition for Syria or a way to stop the violence. Yahya Aridi spokesman for the Syrian opposition Geneva delegation said on Sunday it was now time for the Syrian government and the opposition to ""get to the table and start talking about transition from dictatorship to freedom"" in Geneva.",jordantimes,11/16/17

But subsequent jihadist abuses quickly turned the Syrian opposition including Islamists against ISIL. Rebels launched a major anti-ISIL offensive in January 2014 and have pushed them out of large swathes of Aleppo province and all of Idlib in the northwest. However ISIL remains firmly rooted in Raqa its northern Syrian headquarters and wields significant power in Deir Ezzor in the east near the border with Iraq.

1926479355,Rebels launch assault in Syrias divided Aleppo,Tuesday 12 July 2016 Rebels launch assault in Syrias divided Aleppo. Rebel fighters launched a major assault on government-held districts of Syrias long-divided Aleppo on Monday after the regime severed their only remaining supply route into the battleground city. Once Syrias economic powerhouse Aleppo has been ravaged by the war that began with anti-government protests in 2011 and which has since killed more than 280000 people. Rebels launched the offensive at dawn to reopen the Castello Road their last lifeline into the northern city an AFP correspondent said. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 19 regime forces were killed Monday when rebels blew up a tunnel in the Old City. Observatory chief Rami Abdel Rahman said: The opposition has not advanced because of the heavy aerial bombardment the regime is carrying out on the areas where fighting is underway. Air raids on the rebel-held parts of Aleppo killed 13 civilians Monday the Observatory said most of them in the Bab al-Maqam neighborhood near the front line. An AFP journalist saw rescue workers help a stocky shirtless man out of the rubble in Bab al-Maqam his face and thick beard caked in dust. The unidentified man entered a field hospital and embraced the limp bodies of two young boys. He was martyred. Hes gone he said crying over the body of one them. Several rounds of UN-brokered talks to end the conflict have failed but the UNs special envoy Staffan de Mistura said Monday that a crucial moment had been reached in efforts to secure a political settlement. But despite the diplomatic flurry fighting has intensified in Aleppo divided between government forces in the west and rebels in the east since mid-2012. Barrage of shells Rebels fired a barrage of at least 300 shells into western Aleppo killing nine civilians the Observatory said. Ahmed a resident of the government-controlled west of the city said his home in the Syria quarter was completely destroyed. The shells have rained down on the western neighborhoods since 4:30 am he told AFP. Residents lifted debris in the Syria quarter and helped neighbors gather their belongings so they could leave in search of shelter elsewhere. Mahmud Abu Malak a spokesman for the Nureddin al-Zanki rebel group described fierce fighting. All kinds of heavy artillery and machine-guns are being used in the assault which is intended to ease the pressure on the Mallah and Handarat fronts he said referring to areas near the rebel supply route into Aleppo. The Castello Road route was effectively severed last Thursday when government forces seized a hilltop within firing range. The advance leaves the opposition-held east of the city cut off and raises the prospect of total siege. On Sunday at least 29 opposition fighters were killed when rebels launched a fruitless assault to push government forces back from the road and reopen the route. Watch: Regional international diplomats struggle over Aleppo Play Video Meagre food stocks The severing of the Castello Road has already created shortages of food and fuel in the east of Aleppo with local market stalls sparsely stocked. There are very few vegetables today because the Castello Road is closed said Abu Mohamed a vendor in the Bustan al-Qasr neighborhood. If we hadnt planted eggplant and zucchini inside the city we wouldnt have had any vegetables at all he said pointing to his meagre stock of vegetables. Residents also described searching in vain for fuel whether for vehicles or home use. The UN says nearly 600000 Syrians live in besieged areas of the country most surrounded by government forces although rebels also use the tactic. The latest violence comes despite an extension until early Tuesday of a nationwide truce declared last week by the government to mark the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr. In northwest Idlib province 17 people including two children were killed in air strikes which the Observatory said were carried out by either regime or allied Russian warplanes. US Secretary of State John Kerry will travel to Moscow this week to seek common ground on how to deal with the ongoing bloodshed it was announced Monday. The current truce does not cover extremists from ISIS or the al-Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front. Also Monday ISIS militants entered the historic city of Palmyra in central Syria for the first time since being defeated there by regime forces in March. But they were killed and the attack was now over according to the Observatory. ISIS fighters also claimed a suicide attack on a rival rebel group in the town of Dumeir east of Damascus on Sunday that killed 16 people.

It also has many hostages including my son. - Col Haitham Afisi former FSA deputy chief of staff The brigade also recently killed Abu Hassan an al-Nusra leader in the town of Salqin in the countryside around Idlib. He was hanged for ""violations committed by al-Nusra against the towns civilians"" according to a statement issued by the brigade. The FSAs special forces seventh division also issued a statement giving al-Nusra 48 hours to release those it took hostage nearly a week ago when it stormed its headquarters in the town of Ain Larouz. Those taken include the divisions commander and several fighters. The statement also called on al-Nusra to return all possessions it had taken and to abide by ""the law of God"" to prevent further bloodshed. Former FSA Deputy Chief of Staff Colonel Haitham Afisi said that over the past eight months al-Nusra had also attacked fighters from groups including the FSA SRF Hazzm Maarat al-Noman martyrs brigade Idlib martyrs brigade and those led by Mithal al-Abdallah and Yusuf al-Hassan. ""Al-Nusra has many enemies. It also has many hostages including my son a brigade commander that has been detained for over four months"" Afisi told al-Araby al-Jadeed. The colonel said the group had lost popular support and become a target itself while that those it had attacked were likely to unite against it. The Nusra Front is an al-Qaeda franchise operating in Syria and Lebanon that aims to overthrow the regime of President Assad in Syria. The group has been designated ""a terrorist organisation"" by many western governments. In early November 2014 al-Nusra started expanding into the countryside around Idlib after clashing with other opposition factions particularly the SRF. Al-Nusra has since seized control of most of the countryside south of Idlib the provincial capital. This article is an edited translation from our Arabic edition.",alaraby,2/23/15

1926479140,Syrian Coalition: Assad Used Chemical Weapons 136 Times since Ghouta Massacre,Wednesday 24 August 2016 16:58 Syrian Coalition: Assad Used Chemical Weapons 136 Times since Ghouta Massacre. The Syrian Coalition called upon the UN Security Council to re-open the file of the Ghouta Massacre and refer it to the International Criminal Court (ICC) to determine perpetrators of the massacre and bring them to justice so as to make sure such a heinous crime cannot be repeated. Reports by independent human rights groups indicated that the Assad regime has used chemical weapons 136 times since the adoption of UN Security Council resolution 2118 on September 27 2013 under which Assads declared stockpiles of chemical weapons were destroyed. The Syrian Coalition stressed that the Assad regime would not have used banned weapons against Syrian civilians had it not been for its total disregard for the international community as well as its sense of protection and impunity. The Syrian Coalition denounced the extraordinary claims made by the Assad regimes UN representative Bashar Aljaafari who on Monday blamed France for the Ghouta Massacre that claimed the lives of over 1127 civilians a third of them women and children. The Coalition said Aljaafaris claims showed the utmost disregard for the victims of the Ghouta Massacre and are a desperate attempt to deny Assads responsibility for the sarin attack on the Damascus suburb of eastern Ghouta. Following the massacre the Assad regime surrendered its cache of chemical weapons under the threat of UN sanctions and the use of force by the United States. Over the past three years the Assad regime has persistently denied responsibility for the Ghouta Massacre while seeking to blame opposition groups. However probes by the United Nations and international organizations produced a mass of evidence and facts pointing to the Assad regimes direct responsibility for the chemical attack on eastern Ghouta.

1965495324,Syria Accuses Rebels of Using Chemical Weapons,"24.08.2013 Syrian state media accused rebels of using chemical arms on Saturday against government troops trying to storm a contested neighborhood of Damascus claiming a major army offensive in recent days had forced the opposition fighters to resort to such weapons ""as their last card."" DAMASCUS Syria (The Associated Press Albert Aji) Syrian state media accused rebels of using chemical arms on Saturday against government troops trying to storm a contested neighborhood of Damascus claiming a major army offensive in recent days had forced the opposition fighters to resort to such weapons ""as their last card."" State TV broadcast images of plastic jugs gas masks vials of an unspecified medication explosives and other items that it said were seized from rebel hideouts. It did not however show any video of soldiers reportedly affected by toxic gas in the fighting in the Jobar neighborhood of Damascus. Still the claims could muddy the debate about who was responsible for an alleged gas attack on rebel-held suburbs of the capital on Wednesday that activists say killed more than 130 people. That attack has spurred demands for an independent investigation and renewed talk of potential international military action if chemical weapons were indeed used. Just hours before the state media reports the UN disarmament chief arrived in Damascus to press President Bashar Assads regime to allow UN experts to investigate Wednesdays alleged attack. The Assad regime has denied allegations that it was behind that attack calling them ""absolutely baseless"" and suggesting they are an attempt to discredit the government. The US Britain France and Russia have urged the Assad regime and the rebels fighting to overthrow him to cooperate with the United Nations and allow a team of experts already in Syria to look into the latest purported use of chemical agents. The UN secretary-general dispatched Angela Kane the high representative for disarmament affairs to push for a speedy investigation into Wednesdays purported attack. She did not speak to reporters upon her arrival in Damascus Saturday. With the pressure increasing on the regime to comply Syrias state media alleged on Saturday that rebels in the contested district of Jobar had used chemical weapons against government troops advancing into the area. The state news agency said several government troops who took part in an offensive experienced severe trouble breathing or even ""suffocation"" after ""armed terrorist groups used chemical weapons."" It was not clear what was meant by ""suffocation"" and the report mentioned no fatalities among the troops. The government refers to rebels fighting to topple Assad as ""terrorists."" ""The Syrian Army achieved major progress in the past days and for that reason the terrorist groups used chemical weapons as their last card"" the Syrian state TV said. That report was followed by an unusual string of breaking alerts on the TVs news scroll that made a series of claims related to the alleged use of chemical arms by rebels in the Jobar neighborhood. One message cited a Syrian TV journalist who is embedded with the troops in the district who said the army confiscated an arms cache that included gas masks and several barrels with ""made in Saudi Arabia"" stamped on them. It did not say what was in the barrels but appeared to suggest that some sort of chemical agent was inside and supplied by Saudi Arabia the regions Sunni Muslim power and a staunch supporter of Syrias Sunni-led revolt. Another news scroll said that troops after overrunning rebel positions discovered antidotes following exposure to chemical agents. The TV said the medicines were produced by a Qatari-German medical supplies company. Qatar is another strong supporter of the Syrian rebels. The report could not be immediately verified. For days the government has been trying to counter rebel allegations that the regime used chemical weapons on civilians in rebel-held areas of eastern Damascus arguing that opposition fighters themselves were responsible for that attack. On Saturday French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said dismissed the government line. ""All the information we have is converging to indicate there was a chemical massacre in Syria near Damascus and that Bashar Assads regime was behind it"" Fabius told reporters during a visit to the West Bank city of Ramallah. He did not elaborate. France has suggested that force could be used against Syria if Assads regime was proven to have used chemical arms. The new talk of potential military action in Syria has made an independent investigation by UN inspectors critical to determine what exactly transpired. The UN experts already in Syria are tasked with investigating three earlier purported chemical attacks in the country one in the village of Khan al-Assal outside the northern city of Aleppo in March as well as two other locations that have been kept secret for security reasons. It took months of negotiations between the UN and Damascus before an agreement was struck to allow the 20-member team into Syria to investigate. Its mandate is limited to those three sites however and it is only charged with determining whether chemical weapons were used not who used them. Syrias Deputy Prime Minister Qadri Jamil told The Associated Press on Thursday that he was personally in favor of a fair transparent international delegation to investigate the latest incident. But he said that would require a new agreement between the government and the United Nations and that the conditions for such a delegation would need to be studied. ... 11 Tags Bashar al-Assad chemical weapons Angela Kane Damascus Community standardsDiscussion Comment via FacebookComment via Sputnik News",sputnik,8/24/13
1923102976,Russian strikes kill 53 civilians in Syrias Deir az-Zour,"Date of publication 27 November 2017 At least 53 civilians including 21 children died on Sunday when Russian air strikes hit residential buildings in a village held by Islamic State militants. Tags Russia Syria Assad Deir az-Zour Islamic State SOHR At least 53 civilians including 21 children perished early Sunday morning when Russian air strikes hit ""residential buildings"" in a village held by the Islamic State group in eastern Syria a monitor said. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the strikes hit the village of Al-Shafah in Deir az-Zour province on the eastern bank of the Euphrates River. The Observatory relies on a network of sources inside Syria and says it determines whose planes carry out raids according to type location flight patterns and munitions used. The monitor had initially given a death toll of 34 civilians but the number spiked after more bodies were recovered. ""The toll increased after removing the debris in a long day of rescue operation"" Rami Abdel Rahman head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights told AFP adding the strikes hit ""residential buildings"". At least 18 people were also wounded in the air raids he added. Russia is a close ally of Syrias President Bashar al-Assad and in September 2015 began a military intervention in support of his government that has gradually helped Damascus regain territory. Syrias Deir az-Zour is one of the last places IS jihadists hold territory in the country after being driven from their major strongholds including their one-time de facto Syrian capital Raqqa city. The oil-rich eastern province that borders Iraq was once almost completely under IS control but the jihadists now hold just nine percent of Deir az-Zour according to the Observatory. They have faced two separate offensives there one led by the regime with Russian backing and the other by the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces an alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters. Russia in drivers seat The latest strikes come as the United Nations tries to revitalise its flagging efforts to end a six-year civil war that has left Syria devastated and huge swathes of its population refugees. Syrias Deir az-Zour [click to enlarge] On Tuesday the eighth round of UN-brokered talks will kick off. They have achieved little so far but may be bolstered by the oppositions decision to bring a unified delegation to Geneva for the first time. For progress to happen rival sides will need to overcome the hurdle that has derailed past discussions the fate of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. He retains Moscows support but is loathed by much of Syrias rebel opposition who want him gone. Backed by Russias decisive military support Assads government has regained control of 55 percent of the country including major cities Damascus Aleppo Homs and Hama and around two-thirds of the population lives in regime-held areas. The rest is carved up between rebel factions jihadists and Kurdish forces. Some experts believe that Russia has clearly put itself in the drivers seat in recent months especially as US President Donald Trumps administration has pulled back from Syrian diplomatic front. Russia fellow regime ally Iran and rebel-backer Turkey have hosted negotiations in the Kazakh capital Astana that led to the creation of four ""de-escalation zones"" which produced a drop in violence though deadly air strikes and battles continue in some areas. And this week Russian President Vladimir Putin called for a ""congress"" of Syrian regime and opposition figures a move backed by Ankara and Tehran. The Syrian conflict began when the Baath regime in power since 1963 and led by Assad responded with military force to peaceful protests demanding democratic reforms during the Arab Spring wave of uprisings triggering an armed rebellion fuelled by mass defections from the Syrian army. The brutal tactics pursued mainly by the regime which have included the use of chemical weapons sieges mass executions and torture against civilians have led to war crimes investigations.

1926479330,Death toll mounts after bomb blast on Aleppo evacuee bus convoy,Saturday 15 April 2017 Death toll mounts after bomb blast on Aleppo evacuee bus convoy. A bomb blast hit a bus convoy waiting to enter Aleppo on Saturday killing at least 100 and wounding hundreds more after an evacuation deal between Syrias warring sides halted and stranded thousands at two transit points on the city outskirts. Images posted by the outlets showed bodies lying next to charred buses with their windows blown out and flaming vehicles belching out thick black smoke. British-based monitor the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights counted 24 dead and dozens more wounded. The blast hit buses in the Rashidin area on Aleppos outskirts which had been waiting to cross from rebel-held territory into the government-controlled city itself carrying people evacuated from two Shiite villages on Friday. The residents alongside hundreds of pro-government fighters had left the two rebel-besieged villages in northwest Idlib province under a deal where in exchange hundreds of Sunni insurgents and their families moved out of a government-besieged area near Damascus. But a delay in the agreement had left all those evacuated stuck at two transit points on Aleppos outskirts since late on Friday. Residents of al-Foua and Kefraya the Shiite villages were waiting in the Rashidin area. The rebels and residents of Madaya near Damascus were waiting at the government-held Ramousah bus garage a few miles away. They were to be transported to Idlib province which the armed opposition controls. The agreement is one of several over recent months that has seen President Bashar al-Assads government take back control of areas long besieged by his forces and their allies. The Observatory said the delay was caused by the fact that rebels from Zabadani another town near Damascus included in the deal had not yet been granted safe passage out. A pro-opposition activist said insurgents blamed the delay partly on the fact that a smaller number of pro-government fighters had left the Shiite villages than was agreed. Earlier on Saturday at the transit point where the buses from al-Foua and Kefraya were waiting one resident said he was not yet sure where he would live. After Aleppo Ill see what the rest of the group is doing if there are any preparations. My house land and belongings are all in al-Foua Mehdi Tahhan said. We had no choice A Madaya resident speaking from the bus garage inside Aleppo said people had been waiting there since late on Friday and were not being allowed to leave. Theres no drinking water or food. The bus garage is small so theres not much space to move around Ahmed 24 said. Were sad and angry about what has happened he said. Many people felt that they had been forced to leave he said. There was no other choice in the end - we were besieged inside a small area in Madaya. Syrias opposition says the evacuation deals which include areas of Aleppo and a district in the city of Homs amount to forced displacement of Assads opponents from Syrias main urban centers in the west of the country. The agreements are also causing demographic changes they say because those who are displaced are mostly Sunni Muslims. Syrias population is mostly Sunni. Assad is from the Alawite religious minority often considered an offshoot of Shiite Islam. He has been backed militarily by Russia and by Shiite fighters from Iran and the Lebanese Hezbollah group in Syrias six-year-old conflict. Assad has the military advantage over rebels in the west thanks to Russias intervention in 2015 although the insurgents are still fighting back and have made gains in some areas.,arabiya,4/15/17

The rebels also targeted government positions east of Aleppo city and in the coastal province of Latakia including the Hmeimim military base used by Russian forces allied with the regime. Moscow says it has not bombed Aleppo since October 18 but senior Russian military official Sergei Rudskoi told a briefing Friday that the military had asked President Vladimir Putin for authorisation to resume its air strikes. ""We have appealed to the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation with a request to resume air strikes"" Rudskoi said. But the Kremlin said Putin did not agree.

Fighting was continuing in the area near a military academy it said but had no immediate toll. An AFP correspondent in east Aleppo said the assault had boosted morale in rebel-held districts with mosques broadcasting ""God is greatest"" from loudspeakers. He said residents burned tyres to create smoke and provide cover against air attack. Heavy rain put the fires out but also hampered Syrian air operations creating what one rebel dubbed ""a divine no-fly zone"". The Observatory said rebels had also fired dozens of rockets at the Nairab military airport and Aleppo international airport both east of the city and government-controlled.

Once Syrias economic powerhouse Aleppo has been ravaged by the conflict that began in March 2011 with anti-government protests and has since killed more than 300000 people. Aleppo has been divided between government control in the west and rebel control in the east since mid-2012 and in September the army announced an operation to recapture the whole city. The UNs aid chief Stephen OBrien this week said Aleppo had become ""a kill zone"" adding that ""nothing is actually happening to stop the war stop the suffering"". Last week Russia implemented a three-day ""humanitarian truce"" intended to allow civilians and surrendering rebels to leave the east. But few did so and a UN plan to evacuate the wounded failed because security could not be guaranteed. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accused UN agencies Friday of ""not being professional enough"" over Aleppo. Speaking in Moscow after meeting the Syrian and Iranian foreign ministers he said ""Their inaction allowed the medical evacuation to be sabotaged."" UN chief Ban Ki-moon meanwhile condemned an attack on a school in government-held west Aleppo on Thursday that killed at killed at least six children according to state media.

1914947530,Syria attack symptoms consistent with nerve agent use WHO,"Wed 05 Apr 2017 Syria attack symptoms consistent with nerve agent use WHO. Victims of a suspected chemical attack in Syria appeared to show symptoms consistent with reaction to a nerve agent the World Health Organization said on Wednesday. ""Some cases appear to show additional signs consistent with exposure to organophosphorus chemicals a category of chemicals that includes nerve agents"" WHO said in a statement putting the death toll at at least 70. The United States has said the deaths were caused by sarin nerve gas dropped by Syrian aircraft. Russia has said it believes poison gas had leaked from a rebel chemical weapons depot struck by Syrian bombs. Sarin is an organophosporus compound and a nerve agent. Chlorine and mustard gas which are also believed to have been used in the past in Syria are not. A Russian Defence Ministry spokesman did not say what agent was used in the attack but said the rebels had used the same chemical weapons in Aleppo last year. The WHO said it was likely that some kind of chemical was used in the attack because sufferers had no apparent external injuries and died from a rapid onset of similar symptoms including acute respiratory distress. It said its experts in Turkey were giving guidance to overwhelmed health workers in Idlib on the diagnosis and treatment of patients and medicines such as Atropine an antidote for some types of chemical exposure and steroids for symptomatic treatment had been sent. A U.N. Commission of Inquiry into human rights in Syria has previously said forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad have used lethal chlorine gas on multiple occasions. Hundreds of civilians died in a sarin gas attack in Ghouta on the outskirts of Damascus in August 2013. Assads government has always denied responsibility for that attack. Syria agreed to destroy its chemical weapons in 2013 under a deal brokered by Moscow and Washington. But Russia a Syrian ally and China have repeatedly vetoed any United Nations move to sanction Assad or refer the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court. ""These types of weapons are banned by international law because they represent an intolerable barbarism"" Peter Salama Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme said in the WHO statement. - REUTERS",nna,4/5/17

1926479037,Saudi Arabia calls for emergency U.N. Council meeting on Syria,August 21 2013 Saudi Arabia calls for emergency U.N. Council meeting on Syria. Saudi Arabia called on Wednesday for an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting to discuss reports of a chemical attack that opposition groups say killed hundreds of people in Syria. It is time for the Security Council to shoulder its responsibility and overcome differences between its members and restore the confidence of the international community by convening immediately to issue a clear and deterrent resolution that will put an end to this human crisis Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal said in a statement. Leading Syrian opposition figure George Sabra said in Turkey the attack in which chemical weapons were used had killed 1300 people. Syria described the reports its army had used chemical weapons as completely untrue. Video footage from districts east of Damascus showed people choking some of them foaming at the mouth and many bodies with no signs of injuries. Prince Saud whose country has been a major supporter of rebels fighting to topple Assad also urged European Union foreign ministers meeting in Brussels to discuss the Syrian crisis. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia ... warns that continuing to shy away from responsibility in dealing with the Syrian crisis will lead to more of these tragedies he said. A U.N. team is in Syria investigating allegations that both rebels and government forces have used chemical weapons in the past. The Swedish scientist leading the team Ake Sellstrom said the latest reports should be looked into but doing so would require a request from a U.N. member state.

1924058032,Dozens dead as car bomb hits Syria evacuees | Jordan Times,"Last updated at Apr 152017 A suicide car bomb attack on buses carrying Syrians evacuated from two besieged government-held towns killed 43 people on Saturday as US-backed fighters advanced in their push towards the Daesh terror groups Raqqa stronghold. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the blast targeted buses carrying residents evacuated from the northern towns of Fuaa and Kafraya under a deal reached between the regime and rebels. Bodies were still being recovered from the attack at a transit point in Rashidin west of Aleppo according to the observatory. ""The suicide bomber was driving a van supposedly carrying aid supplies and detonated near the buses"" the monitoring group said. It said that most of the dead were evacuees but also included several rebels who had been guarding the buses. Thousands of evacuees had been stuck on the road because of a disagreement over the number of rebels allowed to leave two other towns included in the deal but the process restarted following the blast the observatory said. AFPs reporter in rebel-held Rashidin saw several bodies body parts and blood scattered on the ground. The bombing took place as thousands of evacuees from Fuaa and Kafraya waited to continue their journey to regime-controlled Aleppo the coastal province of Latakia or Damascus. More than 5000 people who had lived under crippling siege for more than two years left the two towns along with 2200 evacuated from rebel-held Madaya and Zabadani on Friday. Syrias war has left more than 320000 people dead since erupting in 2011 with more than half the population forced from their homes and hundreds of thousands enduring siege-like conditions. It has sucked in regional and international powers and allowed extremist groups to seize vast areas of the country. US-backed fighters reached the outskirts of a key extremist-held town in northern Syria on Saturday as part of an offensive aimed at the Daesh bastion of Raqqa. SDF advances The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) an Arab-Kurdish alliance supported by US-led coalition air strikes and special forces advisers surrounded Tabaqa in early April and have cut its main supply routes. The town and a vast nearby dam are considered key prizes in the broader offensive for Raqqa the de facto Syrian capital of Daeshs self-proclaimed caliphate about 55 kilometres to the east. An SDF military source said Saturday that clashes were fierce and that the alliances forces were trying to penetrate the town from the east and west. The alliance was reported to have advanced overnight after driving the extremists from two areas just southeast and southwest of the town. SDF fighters are within a few hundred metres of Tabaqa said observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman. He said heavy clashes were under way around the two suburbs as Daesh attempted to counter-attack. The SDF launched its campaign for Raqqa in November and has since captured most of the surrounding province. It has been backed by US-led coalition air strikes along with advisers and even an American Marines artillery battery. Raqqa was home to around 240000 residents before 2011 and more than 80000 people have fled to the city from other parts of the country since the start of Syrias civil war. Tabaqa sits on a key supply route into Raqqa and served as an important Daesh command base housing the groups main prison. Backed by Russia and local militias pro-government forces have made a string of recent gains. The government and rebels have brokered a series of deals to evacuate people from besieged areas which Damascus touts as the best way to end the violence. Rebels say they are forced out by siege and bombardment. The deal involving the evacuees targeted on Saturday has been beset by delays and the 5000 Fuaa and Kafraya residents had waited in Rashidin for more than a day without moving before the bomb went off an AFP correspondent said. Around 2220 evacuees from Madaya and Zabadani were similarly blocked at a transit point in government-held territory one of them told AFP by telephone. State television said the car bombing had been carried out by terrorist groups a term the regime applies to all armed opposition groups. Many residents had earlier expressed regret over not knowing when if ever they would be able to return to their homes. Its terrible to be uprooted like this to go and live in a place that is not ours said Jama Nayef a vet from Fuaa.",jordantimes,4/13/17

The rest of the dead in the raids on the city of Raqa were ISIL militants the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Dozens of people were also wounded in the raids which took place on Saturday and Sunday. The US-led coalition which launched an air war against ISIL in Syria last September said it had carried out ""significant"" air strikes against Raqa. ""The significant air strikes tonight were executed to deny Daesh (ISIL) the ability to move military capabilities throughout Syria and into Iraq"" spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Gilleran said. ""This was one of the largest deliberate engagements we have conducted to date in Syria and it will have debilitating effects on Daeshs ability to move from Raqa."" Coalition forces ""successfully engaged multiple targets"" throughout Raqa the statement said destroying IS structures and transit routes. The strikes ""have severely constricted terrorist freedom of movement"" it added. Washington is leading an international coalition fighting ISIL in Syria and Iraq where the extremist group has proclaimed an Islamic ""caliphate"" in territory under its control. However many reports make doubts about the real intentions of the US raids pointing out that the coalition warplanes had dropped weapons and several supplies to the Takfiri insurgents.

1923848136,US-backed Syrian fighters pressing IS gunmen in north,US-backed Syrian fighters pressing IS gunmen in north US-backed Syrian fighters are pushing ahead in their offensive in northern Syria against members of the Islamic State group under the cover of U.S.-led coalition airstrikes. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says the fighting between Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces and IS members on the eastern outskirts of the town of Tabqa left at least 11 extremists dead. The SDF said on social media Monday that its fighters marched about 3 kilometers (2 miles) from the eastern side of Tabqa the location of Syrias largest dam. Last week SDF fighters captured the area of Safsafeh east of Tabqa laying siege to the town. On March 22 U.S. aircraft ferried forces behind militant lines in the Tabqa area to spearhead a major assault near the extremists de facto capital Raqqa.,ahram,4/10/17
1924058147,At least 126 dead in blast targeting evacuation convoy stranded near Aleppo,"Published April 15 2017 At least 126 people including 68 children were killed Saturday in a suicide car bomb attack on buses carrying Syrians evacuated from two besieged regime-held towns a monitoring group said Sunday. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that 98 evacuees from the northern towns of Fuaa and Kafraya were killed when an explosives-laden vehicle hit their buses at a transit point west of Aleppo on Saturday. The dead included 109 evacuees 13 of whom were women from the villages of Foua and Kefraya in the north-western province of Idlib the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The other fatalities were escorts and fighters who were on the site of the bombing outside the northern city of Aleppo according to the Britain-based watchdog. The toll is expected to rise because there are still critically injured and missing people after the blast the Observatory said. The blast hit the Rashidin area on Aleppos outskirts where dozens of buses carrying mostly Shiiite residents of two villages al-Foua and Kefraya that are being evacuated in a deal between warring sides were waiting to enter the city. The state TV channel said the explosion was caused by a car bomb. State TV showed horrific images of bodies strewn on the ground and near buses. A senior opposition official said 20 fighters who guarded the buses were killed as well as dozens of passengers. He spoke on the condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the media. A military media unit run by Damascus ally Hezbollah said a suicide attacker had detonated a car bomb near the convoy. Pictures posted on state media showed what appeared to be the aftermath of the explosion with bodies lying on the ground and fires belching out thick black plumes of smoke. Buses were blackened by the blast with their windows blown out. Thousands of Syrians were stuck in and around Aleppo on Saturday as a deal to evacuate people from two Shiite villages in return for Sunni opposition fighters and their families leaving two besieged towns near Damascus halted a war monitor and activists said. The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said the delay was because opposition groups from Zabadani one of the towns included in the deal had not yet been granted safe passage out. The agreement is one of several concluded in recent months that has seen Bashar al-Assads regime take back control of areas long besieged by his forces and their allies. In the latest deal hundreds of rebels and their families evacuated the town of Madaya near Damascus and were taken to the regime-held city of Aleppo. From there they will travel to Idlib province an opposition stronghold. In return pro-regime fighters and residents from the Shiite villages of al-Foua and Kefraya both surrounded by Idlib opposition fighters have left the area and reached Aleppos outskirts. On Saturday those from Madaya sat outside rows of coaches in a bus garage in government-held Aleppo waiting to move onto Idlib pictures sent by a pro-opposition activist showed. Meanwhile residents from the Shiite villages were still waiting in insurgent territory on Aleppos outskirts to cross into the city the Observatory and a witness said. The pro-opposition activist said opposition fighters were saying that a smaller number of pro-regime fighters had left the Shiite villages than was agreed. A Madaya resident speaking from the bus garage in Aleppo said people had been waiting there since late on Friday night and were not being allowed to leave. ""Theres no drinking water or food. The bus garage is small so theres not much space to move around"" Ahmed 24 said. ""Were sad and angry about what has happened"" he said. Many people felt that they had been forced to leave he said. ""There was no other choice in the end - we were besieged inside a small area in Madaya."" Syrias opposition says the evacuation deals which have included areas of Aleppo and a district in the western city of Homs amount to forced displacement of Assads opponents from Syrias main urban centers. The agreements are also causing demographic changes they say because those who are displaced are mostly Sunni Muslims. Syrias population is mostly Sunni. Assad is from the Alawite religious minority often considered an offshoot of Shiite Islam. He has been backed militarily by Russia and by Shiite fighters from Iran and the Lebanese Hezbollah group in Syrias six-year-old conflict. Assad holds the military advantage over the opposition in the west of the country thanks to Russias intervention in 2015 although the insurgents continue to fight back and have made gains in some areas.",dailysabah,4/5/17

The identity of the drone was not confirmed but the sources did not rule out the possibility that it was Russian ""friendly fire"". (AFP) A drone strike on Monday killed at least eight members of the Hezbollah militia in Syria where the Lebanese group is fighting alongside the Syrian regime a Britain-based monitor said. An unidentified ""drone hit a Hezbollah position near the town of Sukhna (in central Homs province) killing eight fighters and injuring more than 20"" said Rami Abdel Rahman the head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor. Asked about a report that a US drone carried out the strike the spokesman for the US-led coalition said the location was outside its area of operations. Hezbollah is a key force multiplier for Syrian regime leader Bashar al Assad and has fought alongside his forces across the country against rebel forces. Assads forces and allied fighters are currently waging a campaign in Syrias vast Badiya desert region against Daesh. The campaign backed by Assad ally Russia has captured large swathes of territory from the terror group but they have launched deadly counterattacks on regime positions. On Sunday Daesh fighters recaptured the town of Al Qaryatain in Homs province which regime forces took from the group in April 2016. More than 330000 people have been killed in Syria since the conflict began in March 2011 with anti-regime protests but some non-governmental organisations put the death toll a lot higher.

""Straight after the coalitions strikes IS militants launched an offensive"" said the statement adding that ""fierce fighting against the terrorists"" ensued nearby. ""If these strikes were due to an error in the target coordinates that would be a direct consequence of the US refusal to coordinate with Russia its fight against the terrorist groups in Syria"" it said. While Russian jets deployed in Syria were not operating in the area at the time of the coalition strikes they later intervened ""in support of the Syrian army by targeting IS"" Russian General Vladimir Savchenko said.

Several villages held by Islamic State have been captured by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) a coalition of militias backed by the United States that includes a strong Kurdish contingent an organisation that monitors the war said on Monday. Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) fighters walk in Tal Samin village north of Raqqa city Syria November 19 2016. REUTERS/Rodi Said The advance is part of a military campaign backed by an international coalition led by the United States to drive Islamic State from its Syrian capital of Raqqa. It follows SDF gains against the jihadist group across the north of the country. The strongest group in the SDF is the Peoples Protection Units or YPG a Kurdish militia but Washington has said that any operation to retake Raqqa should be predominantly Arab the ethnicity of most of the citys residents. The latest advances in the countryside about 50 km (30 miles) west and northwest of Raqqa follow an earlier phase of SDF gains on another front about 30 km north of the city. Three SDF soldiers were killed fighting Islamic State after the capture of five villages the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a Britain-based war monitor said on Monday. Islamic State had been on the back foot in both Syria and Iraq where it is under attack in Mosul its biggest and most important possession and after a string of U.S. air strikes that have killed many of its leaders this year. However earlier this month it launched a surprise attack 160 km southwest of Raqqa to retake the ancient desert city of Palmyra which it had lost in March to Syrian army forces backed by Russian air power after a nine-month occupation. That attack demonstrated the risks still posed by the group across Syria even after its territorial losses there since mid-2015 including holdings along the Turkish border which were once its main route for supplies and recruits. Complicating the efforts against Islamic State is a second campaign being waged against it in northwest Syria by Turkey and Syrian rebel groups allied to Ankara. This has taken a large area from the jihadist group but is also aimed at stopping Kurdish expansion. The Turkish-backed Syrian rebels are now attempting to capture the city of al-Bab from Islamic State a move that will end Kurdish hopes of uniting their two separated areas of self rule in northern Syria. Early on Monday the Turkish military said one of its soldiers had been killed in a car bomb in al-Bab on Sunday and that 11 militants were also killed in clashes that day.

Tags Syria Assad Russia Eastern Ghouta Douma airstrikes More than 19 civilians were killed in Eastern Ghouta on Sunday as the Syrian regime stepped up its campaign to retake the last major opposition stronghold near the capital Damascus. At least 123 civilians have been killed in the besieged suburb by airstrikes and shelling since the Syrian regime and Russian jets began an offensive nearly two weeks ago the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. A witness told Reuters that there had been drones in the sky since Sunday morning with warplanes heavily bombing the towns of Mesraba Harasta and Eastern Ghouta killing at least 19 civilians. The opposition Eastern Ghouta Damascus Countryside local council said this week that the intensifying bombardments were forcing people to seek shelter in unsuitable and unsanitary places which it feared could lead to disease outbreaks. Eastern Ghouta has been under siege by Syrian regime forces since 2013 and no food aid convoys have entered the town of Douma since wheat flour rations in August. Civilians are eating rubbish fainting from hunger and forcing their children to eat on alternate days because of the food shortage the UN World Food Programme said this week. Nearly 174500 people trapped in the town of Douma since September have been forced to adopt emergency ""coping strategies"" the UN said. WFP expects the situation to further deteriorate in the coming weeks when the current food stock is expected to be depleted completely eroding the current household coping strategies. In the east of Syria Russian air strikes on Sunday killed 34 civilians among them 15 children in a village held by Islamic State in Deir az-Zour province an activist group said. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the strikes hit the village of Al-Shafah on the eastern bank of the Euphrates River in the early hours of Sunday morning. The Syrian conflict began when the Baath regime in power since 1963 and led by Assad responded with military force to peaceful protests demanding democratic reforms during the Arab Spring wave of uprisings triggering an armed rebellion fuelled by mass defections from the Syrian army. The brutal tactics pursued mainly by the regime which have included the use of chemical weapons sieges mass executions and torture against civilians have led to war crimes investigations.

The civilians were massacred in reprisal for collaborating with the government of Bashar al-Assad. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) reported that the killings occurred over a 20 day period. The Syrian army retook the city in April 2016 after eight months of Daesh occupation. However Daesh chased the government forces out on October 1 but the Syrian army regrouped and returned three weeks later recapturing the city once more with support from Russian airstrikes. But in that three-week period Daesh executed 128 residents of the town which had a population of about 18000 before the civil war started. The Palmyra Coordination Committee a local group that supports protest and resistance against the Syrian government reported that at least 35 of the slain were found with their bodies dumped in a mine shaft. Sputnik Hikmet Durgun US-Led Coalition Confirms Syrias Raqqa Completely Liberated From Daesh ""After the regime retook it [on Saturday] the towns residents found the bodies on the streets.

They are from the town know the towns residents and who is for or against the regime"" he added. The more human rights groups and government forces search the more corpses they discover. Of the Daesh executioners one resident of the town told the Associated Press ""These are people who dont know God they dont know anything. They killed children and women with knives they beat women broke their arms."" SOHR added that at least 12 residents of the town were killed by government forces after they regained control of Al-Qaryatayn. Sputnik HKMET DURGUN Syrian Democratic Forces Recapture Oil Field in Deir ez-Zor Province Al-Qaryatayn had a large Christian minority but the war has obliterated their population as Daesh goes out of their way to target non-Muslims. Many of the towns Catholic and Orthodox Christian minorities have been abducted or killed or have fled the area reducing the Christian population from 2000 to a few hundred. The ancient oasis town believed to have been populated by people since 1750 BC was used by Daesh to protect the nearby city of Palmyra which they captured in May 2015.

1923102896,Russia says Belgian strikes kill six in Aleppo region,"Date of publication 19 October 2016 Russia has accused Belgium of killing civilians in Aleppo while partaking in coalition strikes. Tags Belgium Syria coalition air raids strikes Aleppo Russia has accused Belgium a member of a US-led coalition fighting militants in Syria of killing six civilians in airstrikes in the Aleppo region but the claim was swiftly denied by Brussels. ""Six people were killed and four people injured to various degrees as a result of bombing that destroyed two homes"" in the village of Hassajik in the Aleppo region early on Tuesday the Russian defence ministry said in a statement. ""Two of Belgiums F-16s were identified at that time in the region"" it said late Tuesday. ""There were no Russian and Syrian air force planes in this region."" Belgian defence ministry spokeswoman Laurence Mortier denied the countrys air force was active in the area at the time. Moscow had announced on Tuesday that the Russian and Syrian air forces had stopped bombing Aleppo to pave the way for an eight-hour truce on Thursday. Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova took a jab at the United States on Wednesday calling on the State Department to release statements ""strongly condemning strikes against civilian targets and the murder of civilians"". ""I think that photographs of the dead will not be difficult to find to launch an appropriate campaign on CNN"" she wrote on Facebook. The brutal government offensive against rebel-held eastern Aleppo - which has destroyed hospitals and other civilian infrastructure - has plunged Syria into some of the worst violence of the five-year war that has claimed over 300000 lives. The West has accused Russia of potential war crimes over its bombing campaign in Aleppo in support of the regime offensive. The US State Department voiced scepticism regarding Moscows planned truce while welcoming a halt in the bombardments. President Vladimir Putin is set to face Western pressure over the conflicts in Syria and Ukraine at international talks in Berlin on Wednesday as Russia comes under increasing criticism over its support for Damascus. Russian airstrikes have killed thousands of civilians since Moscow intervened in September 2015. But US-led coalition strikes have also claimed hundreds of civilian lives in parts of Syria. According to a report by the Syrian Network for Human Rights published on Wednesday coalition strikes targeting mainly IS-held areas in eastern and northern Syria have killed 649 civilians since September 2014.

1924058047,Syria regime advances on rebels in Aleppo _ monitor | Jordan Times,"Last updated at Jul 262016 BEIRUT Syrian government forces on Tuesday seized a rebel-held neighbourhood in the northwest edge of Aleppo tightening their siege of opposition-controlled parts of the city a monitor said. The government also carried out renewed barrel bomb attacks on opposition-held districts a day after bombardments killed at least 24 people the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The Britain-based monitor said regime troops had full control of the Leramun district after heavy clashes. It also reported intense fighting for neighbouring rebel-held district of Bani Zeid. The two areas have been used by rebels to launch rockets into government-held districts in the citys west. Aleppo has been roughly divided between government control in the west and rebel control in the east since mid-2012. In recent weeks regime advances have severed the only remaining route into the rebel-held eastern neighbourhoods effectively placing them under siege. Opposition forces have responded by firing missiles into government districts killing scores of civilians. ""The importance of capturing Leramun and Bani Zeid is to stop the missile fire and also to further tighten the siege"" said observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman. He said government forces had now surrounded Bani Zeid reporting heavy air strikes in the area and clashes. The monitor had no immediate toll in the fighting. Government forces effectively severed the oppositions main supply route on July 7 when they advanced to within firing range of the Castello Road. They have since tightened the encirclement of the rebel-held east taking parts of the road itself and causing food shortages and spiralling prices in opposition neighbourhoods. Syrias Al Watan daily which is close to the government also reported advances in Leramun an industrial area that once housed scores of factories. State news agency SANA broadcast a call from the military urging residents of eastern Aleppo to ""join the national reconciliation and expel the foreign mercenaries"" from their neighbourhoods. It said the army had sent text messages to residents and fighters in the east urging rebels to lay down their weapons and identifying safe passages for civilians wishing to leave. Government forces continued to pound opposition areas on Tuesday with the observatory reporting a new barrel bomb attack on the district of Al Mashhad. It said five civilians including three children were killed. On Monday at least 24 people including five children and two women were killed in a barrel bomb attack on the same neighbourhood according to a new toll from the observatory. A statement from the UN childrens agency UNICEF on Tuesday condemned weekend air raids on four hospitals in Aleppo calling them a blatant violation of international humanitarian law that may amount to war crimes. On the humanitarian front a 48-truck aid convoy on Tuesday entered regime-besieged Talbiseh in Homs province with food and other supplies for 40000 people the International Committee of the Red Cross said. More than 280000 people have been killed in Syria since the conflict began in March 2011 with anti-government protests that were met with a regime crackdown.",jordantimes,7/13/16
